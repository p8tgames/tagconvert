# TagConvert Alpha (by p8tgames)
This program can be used to transfer file names to tags.
For example, if an File is named:
```100 - Undertale OST - MEGALOVANIA.flac```
this program will rename it to
```MEGALOVANIA.flac```
and store the rest of its contents as Media Tags.
You can only splice it to 3 segments (seperated by "-")
First one being the Track Number, second one being the Album name, third one being song name.
The Program will also ask for the Interpret, if you wish that.

If the program can't work with your file, itll display an exception.

You cannot specify only one file at the momennt.

The folder you specify can ONLY include Media files. It can be multiple albums, but it cannot include an normal file.
If you did everything correctly, your folder should look like this:


1 - FFVII OST - The Prelude.wav

2 - FFVII OST - The Bombing Misssion.wav

100 - Undertale OST - MEGALOVANIA.FLAC
