# TagConvert Alpha (by p8tgames)
This program can be used to transfer file names to tags.
For example, if an File is named:
```100 - Undertale OST - MEGALOVANIA.flac```
this program will rename it to
```MEGALOVANIA.flac```
and store the rest of its contents as Media Tags.
You can only splice it to 3 segments (seperated by "-")
First one being the Track Number, second one being the Album name, third one being song name.
The Program will also ask for the Interpret, if you wish that.
